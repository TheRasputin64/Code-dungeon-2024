*created at 3am by someone who talks to computers*

# What's new (unfortunately):
- added `audio_processor.py` - now you can avoid talking in real-time... great
- more dependencies (because we needed those):
  ```bash
  pip install transformers
  pip install librosa
  pip install numpy
  ```
- accepts audio files (WAV/MP3) for those who prefer pre-recorded emptiness
- might actually understand you (scary)
